BlueJ example project "people2"

Copyright (c) Michael KÃ¶lling, Monash University, 1999-2000

This is a very simple BlueJ demo project. It illustrates some aspects of
object-orientation as well as aspects of BlueJ.

This project is an extension of "people". It is identical to "people"
except for the addition of an "Address" class and an address attribute
in Person.

This project may be used to study object creation and method calls from
within other object (non-interactive).
