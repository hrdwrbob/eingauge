BlueJ example project "people"

Copyright (c) Michael KÃ¶lling, Monash University, 1999-2000

This is a very simple BlueJ demo project. It illustrates some aspects of
object-orientation as well as aspects of BlueJ.

This project is distributed with the BlueJ system to serve as an introductory
practice example. It is referred to in the BlueJ tutorial. Please read the
tutorial (which you can get by selecting "BlueJ Tutorial..." from the Help
menu ion the BlueJ main window) for more detailed information.

You can use this project as follows:

 - create a few Staff or Student obejcts
 - create a Database object
 - use "addPerson" in Database to add the persons you have created previously
   from the object bench to the database
 - use the "listAll" from the database object to list the contents of the 
   database.

This project illustrates:

 - object creation
 - relationship class-object (create _more then one_ object!)
 - instance data (use "Inspect" on the objects)
 - methods, parameters
 - composition
 - ...
