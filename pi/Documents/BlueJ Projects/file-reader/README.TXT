This is a small demo showing how to access a file in a safe way.
Especially: access to the file does not depend on the current directory,
but files will be found anywhere in the classpath. So text files placed
inside the project directory wll be found.

A file for testing is include in this project. It is called "test.txt".
(You can also access this file - "README.TXT".)
