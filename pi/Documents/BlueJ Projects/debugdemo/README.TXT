BlueJ example project "debugdemo"

Copyright (c) Michael KÃ¶lling, Monash University, 1999-2000

This project is distributed with the BlueJ system to provide an example
for testing the debugger. The project does not make any sense at all. Its 
purpose is to provide some loops and method calls to practice setting
breakpoints and sigle-stepping through the code.

This project is referred to in the BlueJ tutorial.

To start this project, create a "Demo" object and select any of its methods.
