BlueJ example project "hello"

Copyright (c) Michael Kölling, Monash University, 1999-2000

This is "Hello world".

This project is distributed with the BlueJ system to make all those people
happy who want to look at "Hello World" before anything else. 

Please note that I think that this project is totally unsuitable to learn
or teach anything about object-orientation. There is no sensible use of 
objects in this problem, and I do not recommend using it for teaching OO.

You can start this project in two ways:

  - create a "Hello" object and run its "go" method, or
  - execute the static "main" method of the "Hello" class
